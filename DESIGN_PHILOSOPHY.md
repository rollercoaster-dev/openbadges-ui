# OpenBadges UI - Design Philosophy

## Vision

Our vision for the OpenBadges UI component library is to create digital credential experiences that are not only functional and compliant but also empowering, accessible, and genuinely pleasant to use. We aim to move beyond basic display and verification towards fostering understanding and trust in digital badges, particularly for users who often face barriers in conventional digital interfaces.

## Core Principles

Our design and development are guided by the following core principles:

### 1. Neurodiversity-First Design

Accessibility is not an afterthought; it is the bedrock of our design process. We explicitly prioritize the needs of neurodivergent users (including but not limited to ADHD, Autism Spectrum Condition, Dyslexia).

*   **Why:** Conventional interfaces can often be overwhelming, distracting, or illegible for neurodivergent individuals. Designing with their needs in mind from the outset leads to better usability for everyone.
*   **How:**
    *   **Clear Typography:** Utilizing highly legible fonts like Atkinson Hyperlegible in specific themes (`.ob-low-info-theme`) and providing clear guidance on font customization.
    *   **Reduced Clutter:** Embracing minimalist design principles, focusing on essential information and providing ample whitespace.
    *   **Predictable Interactions:** Ensuring UI elements behave consistently and providing clear feedback through considered micro-interactions.
    *   **Sensory Considerations:** Avoiding overly complex animations, jarring contrasts (unless chosen by the user), or potentially triggering patterns.

### 2. Joyful & Empowering Interaction

We strive to create an experience that minimizes friction and anxiety, making the interaction with digital badges intuitive and even enjoyable.

*   **Why:** Digital credentials can be confusing or intimidating. A positive user experience builds trust and encourages engagement.
*   **How:**
    *   **Intuitive Layouts:** Designing components with clear visual hierarchy and logical flow.
    *   **Helpful Feedback:** Implementing subtle micro-interactions that confirm actions and guide the user without being distracting.
    *   **Modern Aesthetics:** Applying clean, contemporary visual design that feels professional and approachable.
    *   **Clarity:** Ensuring all text and labels are easy to understand.

### 3. Deep Customization as Necessity

We recognize that user needs and preferences, especially regarding sensory input, vary significantly. Therefore, extensive customization is treated as a fundamental accessibility feature.

*   **Why:** What one user finds visually appealing or calming, another might find distracting, overwhelming, or even triggering. Choice is paramount for accessibility.
*   **How:**
    *   **Flexible Theming:** Providing a robust CSS custom property system allows consumers to override colors, fonts, spacing, borders, shadows, and more.
    *   **Pre-defined Themes:** Offering base themes (Light, Dark, Low Info) as starting points.
    *   **Font Choice:** Enabling easy overriding of the default font stack to accommodate personal preferences or specific accessibility needs (e.g., OpenDyslexic).

### 4. Adaptive Aesthetics

The library should allow its appearance to adapt to the user's context, mood, or specific needs, offering palettes that can be either calming or invigorating.

*   **Why:** User needs aren't static. Providing options allows the interface to better serve the user in different situations (e.g., needing focus vs. needing stimulation).
*   **How:**
    *   **Theme Mechanism:** The CSS variable system directly supports this. Consumers can create themes (e.g., "Vibrant", "Muted", "High Contrast") by defining appropriate variable overrides.
    *   **Component Design:** Components are built to respect these theme variables, ensuring visual consistency across different aesthetic choices.

## Rationale & Supporting Research

Our principles are informed by:

*   **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):** Adhering to established standards for accessibility.
*   **Inclusive Design Principles:** Designing for the widest possible range of users and abilities.
*   **Neurodiversity Research:** Acknowledging the diverse sensory processing and cognitive styles within the human population.
*   **Modern UI/UX Trends:** Incorporating contemporary best practices like minimalism, clear typography, and meaningful micro-interactions where they align with our core principles.

## Implementation

The primary technical enabler for these principles is the **CSS Custom Property (Variable) System** defined in `src/styles/themes.css`. This allows:

*   **Maintainability:** Centralized control over base styles.
*   **Flexibility:** Easy overrides for consumers to apply their own branding or accessibility adjustments.
*   **Theming:** Simple creation of distinct visual themes by defining variable sets under specific class names (e.g., `.ob-dark-theme`, `.ob-low-info-theme`, or custom consumer themes).
