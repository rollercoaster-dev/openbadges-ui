# Neurodiversity Implementation Task

## Executive Summary

This task involves implementing neurodiversity considerations in the OpenBadges UI component library to make it more accessible and user-friendly for neurodivergent users. The implementation will enhance existing accessibility features and add new ones specifically designed for users with conditions such as ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and dyscalculia.

## Plan for Implementing Neurodiversity Considerations in OpenBadges UI

After reviewing the codebase and researching neurodiversity best practices, I've identified several areas where we can enhance the OpenBadges UI component library to better support neurodivergent users. The project already has a good foundation with its accessibility focus and existing themes (including a dyslexia-friendly theme), but we can expand and improve these features.

### Files to Modify:

1. **src/services/AccessibilityService.ts**
   - Enhance the existing service with neurodiversity-specific features
   - Add methods to support cognitive accessibility needs

2. **src/styles/themes.css**
   - Improve the existing dyslexia-friendly theme
   - Add ADHD-friendly theme options
   - Add autism-friendly theme options

3. **src/styles/accessibility.css**
   - Add neurodiversity-specific CSS rules
   - Enhance existing accessibility styles

4. **src/services/AccessibilityAudit.ts**
   - Add neurodiversity-specific audit checks
   - Enhance cognitive accessibility evaluation

5. **src/components/badges/BadgeDisplay.vue**
   - Improve component to better support neurodivergent users
   - Add neurodiversity-specific props and features

6. **src/components/badges/BadgeList.vue**
   - Enhance list component with neurodiversity considerations
   - Add features to reduce cognitive load

7. **docs/neurodiversity.md**
   - Create new documentation on neurodiversity considerations
   - Provide guidance for developers using the library

### Implementation Details:

1. **src/services/AccessibilityService.ts**:
   - Add methods for text simplification
   - Add support for adjustable content density
   - Add methods to control animation and motion
   - Add support for focus modes to reduce distractions
   - Add methods to support different reading modes

2. **src/styles/themes.css**:
   - Enhance dyslexia-friendly theme with improved typography and spacing
   - Add ADHD-friendly theme with focus on reducing distractions and clear visual hierarchy
   - Add autism-friendly theme with predictable layouts and reduced sensory stimulation
   - Add variables for adjustable animation speeds and motion preferences

3. **src/styles/accessibility.css**:
   - Add styles for reducing visual clutter
   - Add styles for improved text readability
   - Add styles for better focus states
   - Add styles for consistent navigation patterns
   - Add styles for clear visual feedback

4. **src/services/AccessibilityAudit.ts**:
   - Add checks for cognitive load
   - Add checks for clear instructions and feedback
   - Add checks for consistent navigation
   - Add checks for appropriate use of color and contrast
   - Add checks for text complexity and readability

5. **src/components/badges/BadgeDisplay.vue**:
   - Add props for adjustable content density
   - Add props for simplified view options
   - Improve focus states and keyboard navigation
   - Add clear visual feedback for interactions
   - Ensure consistent layout and predictable behavior

6. **src/components/badges/BadgeList.vue**:
   - Add filtering and sorting options to help users find badges
   - Add progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load
   - Add clear pagination controls
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Add options to adjust the display density

7. **docs/neurodiversity.md**:
