# Open Badges Specification Compliance Plan

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the OpenBadges UI library's compliance with the Open Badges 2.0 and 3.0 specifications.

## Current Status

The library currently supports basic functionality for both OB2 and OB3 badge formats, including:

- Display of badge information
- Basic validation of required fields
- Verification of badge authenticity (hosted and signed methods)
- Support for badge issuance

However, there are opportunities to enhance compliance with the specifications, particularly for:

- Comprehensive validation against all specification requirements
- Support for additional badge properties
- Improved handling of edge cases
- Better error messages for validation failures

## Objectives

1. Ensure full compliance with Open Badges 2.0 specification
2. Enhance support for Open Badges 3.0 (Verifiable Credentials)
3. Improve validation and error reporting
4. Add support for additional badge properties
5. Create comprehensive test cases for specification compliance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Specification Review and Gap Analysis (3-4 days)

1. **Detailed Review of Specifications**
   - Review Open Badges 2.0 specification in detail
   - Review Open Badges 3.0 / Verifiable Credentials specification
   - Document all required and optional properties
   - Identify validation rules for each property

2. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current implementation against specifications
   - Identify missing properties and validation rules
   - Document edge cases not currently handled
   - Prioritize gaps based on impact and frequency

3. **Create Compliance Test Cases**
   - Develop test badges that exercise all aspects of the specifications
   - Include both valid and invalid examples
   - Create test cases for edge cases and unusual scenarios

### Phase 2: Enhance OB2 Compliance (4-5 days)

1. **Improve Type Definitions**
   - Update OB2 type definitions to match specification exactly
   - Add missing properties and types
   - Improve documentation of types

2. **Enhance Validation**
   - Implement comprehensive validation for all required properties
   - Add validation for optional properties when present
   - Improve validation error messages
   - Add support for validation of linked resources (e.g., BadgeClass, Issuer)

3. **Add Support for Additional Properties**
   - Implement support for evidence
   - Add support for endorsements
   - Implement handling of extensions
   - Support for revocation lists

4. **Improve Verification**
   - Enhance hosted verification
   - Improve signed verification
   - Add support for verification of linked resources

### Phase 3: Enhance OB3/VC Compliance (5-6 days)

1. **Improve Type Definitions**
   - Update OB3/VC type definitions to match specification exactly
   - Add support for JSON-LD contexts
   - Improve documentation of types

2. **Enhance Validation**
   - Implement comprehensive validation for all required properties
   - Add validation for optional properties when present
   - Improve validation error messages
   - Add support for validation of linked resources

3. **Add Support for Additional Properties**
   - Implement support for evidence
   - Add support for endorsements
   - Implement handling of extensions
   - Support for credential status

4. **Improve Verification**
   - Enhance cryptographic verification
   - Add support for different proof types
   - Implement verification of linked resources

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation (3-4 days)

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test against all created test cases
   - Verify handling of edge cases
   - Test performance with large badge collections
   - Test interoperability with other Open Badges implementations

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Document compliance with specifications
   - Update API documentation to reflect changes
   - Add examples for new features
   - Create migration guide if needed

3. **Create Compliance Report**
   - Document compliance with each aspect of the specifications
   - Identify any remaining gaps or limitations
   - Provide recommendations for future improvements

## Timeline

Total estimated time: **15-19 days**

- Phase 1: 3-4 days
- Phase 2: 4-5 days
- Phase 3: 5-6 days
- Phase 4: 3-4 days

## Success Criteria

The specification compliance enhancement will be considered complete when:

1. The library validates all required properties according to the specifications
2. All supported badge properties are correctly displayed and processed
3. Validation provides clear, helpful error messages
4. Test cases for all aspects of the specifications pass
5. Documentation clearly explains compliance and any limitations
6. The library can interoperate with other Open Badges implementations

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize validation for large badge collections
   - Implement lazy loading of linked resources

2. **Advanced Verification**
   - Add support for more advanced cryptographic verification methods
   - Implement revocation checking against external services

3. **Extensions Support**
   - Add support for common extensions
   - Provide framework for custom extensions
