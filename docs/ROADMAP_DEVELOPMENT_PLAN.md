# Development Roadmap Planning

This document outlines the approach for creating a comprehensive development roadmap for the OpenBadges UI library.

## Objectives

1. Establish a clear direction for future development
2. Prioritize features based on user needs and impact
3. Create a timeline with realistic milestones
4. Communicate the project's vision to stakeholders
5. Guide resource allocation and planning

## Planning Process

### Phase 1: Analysis of Current State (1-2 days)

1. **Feature Inventory**
   - Document all existing features
   - Assess the maturity of each feature
   - Identify areas that need improvement

2. **Technical Debt Assessment**
   - Identify areas of technical debt
   - Assess impact on future development
   - Prioritize debt reduction efforts

3. **Competitive Analysis**
   - Review similar libraries and tools
   - Identify unique selling points
   - Find opportunities for differentiation

### Phase 2: User Needs Assessment (2-3 days)

1. **User Research**
   - Identify key user personas
   - Document user journeys
   - Collect feedback from existing users

2. **Use Case Analysis**
   - Document common use cases
   - Identify pain points in current implementation
   - Discover unmet needs

3. **Feature Requests Review**
   - Analyze existing feature requests
   - Group similar requests
   - Assess frequency and impact

### Phase 3: Roadmap Development (2-3 days)

1. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Create evaluation criteria (impact, effort, strategic alignment)
   - Score potential features
   - Group features into priority tiers

2. **Timeline Development**
   - Create realistic timeframes for development
   - Identify dependencies between features
   - Establish milestones and release targets

3. **Resource Planning**
   - Estimate resource requirements
   - Identify potential constraints
   - Plan for contingencies

### Phase 4: Documentation and Communication (1-2 days)

1. **Roadmap Documentation**
   - Create visual roadmap
   - Document feature details
   - Explain prioritization decisions

2. **Communication Plan**
   - Develop messaging for different stakeholders
   - Create presentation materials
   - Plan for regular updates

## Roadmap Structure

The roadmap will be organized into the following sections:

### 1. Vision and Goals

- Long-term vision for the library
- Strategic goals
- Success metrics

### 2. Release Timeline

- Major releases with themes
- Feature sets for each release
- Estimated timeframes

### 3. Feature Details

For each planned feature:
- Description
- User benefit
- Technical approach
- Dependencies
- Estimated effort

### 4. Maintenance and Support

- Bug fix policy
- Deprecation strategy
- Backward compatibility approach
- Support channels

## Timeline

Total estimated time: **6-10 days**

- Phase 1: 1-2 days
- Phase 2: 2-3 days
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 1-2 days

## Deliverables

1. **Strategic Roadmap Document**
   - High-level overview of direction
   - Key themes and initiatives
   - Timeline visualization

2. **Detailed Feature Plans**
   - Specifications for planned features
   - Prioritization rationale
   - Technical considerations

3. **Release Schedule**
   - Target dates for releases
   - Feature allocation to releases
   - Dependency mapping

## Maintenance Plan

The roadmap will be:
- Reviewed quarterly
- Updated based on user feedback
- Adjusted for changing priorities
- Used to guide sprint planning

## Success Criteria

The roadmap development will be considered successful when:

1. It clearly communicates the project's direction
2. Features are prioritized based on user impact
3. The timeline is realistic and achievable
4. Stakeholders understand and support the plan
5. It provides a useful guide for development decisions
